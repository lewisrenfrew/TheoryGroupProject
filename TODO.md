Current TODO list/Roadmap (Not in the order of implementation):

- Need heuristic to calculate scaling for vector field based on relative size of vectors and grid
- **TESTS** and general tidy up
- Problem 2.4 **needs zip**
- Profiling **General timing function needed**
- Other LERP and ZIPs
- Interpreter (shunting yard/s-exp?)
- UI (Electron)
- Adaptive meshing/Other calculation methods
- Pipe input straight into gnuplot rather than going via the makefile or a shell script
- SIGINT handler

Done:

- Gradient calculation (requires some sort of Vector2 structure)
  - E-field plotting.
- Problem 0
- PixelsToMetres
- Image scaling/Aspect ratio
- JSON loading
