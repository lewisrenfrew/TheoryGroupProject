Current TODO list/Roadmap (Not in the order of implementation):

- Gradient calculation (requires some sort of Vector2 structure)
  - E-field plotting. *started* **The scale appears to be right**

- **TESTS** and general tidy up
- Problem 0 **good progress**
- Problem 2.4 **needs zip**
- Profiling
- Image scaling/Aspect ratio **scaling should be done**
- Other LERP and ZIPs
- Interpreter (shunting yard/s-exp?)
- UI (Electron)
- Adaptive meshing/Other calculation methods
- PixelsToMetres **Roughly implemented for the one function that needs it**
- Need heuristic to calculate scaling for vector field based on relative size of vectors and grid
- Pipe input straight into gnuplot rather than going via the makefile or a shell script
- SIGINT handler
