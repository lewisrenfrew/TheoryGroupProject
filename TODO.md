Current TODO list/Roadmap (Not in the order of implementation):

- Gradient calculation (requires some sort of Vector2 structure)
  - E-field plotting. *started*

- **TESTS** and general tidy up
- Problem 0
- Problem 2.4
- Profiling
- Image scaling/Aspect ratio
- Other LERP and ZIPs
- Interpreter (shunting yard/s-exp?)
- UI (Electron)
- Adaptive meshing/Other calculation methods
- PixelsToMetres
- Pipe input straight into gnuplot rather than going via the makefile or a shell script
